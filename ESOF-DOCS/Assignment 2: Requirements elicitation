Assignment 2: Requirements elicitation

Requerimentos: Introdução, Âmbito e Descrição

A ferramenta deve suportar a criação de estudos médicos.

Create eCRFs "electronic case report form (eCRF)."
The industry defines an eCRF as a collection of a few data elements, corresponding to a
computer screen of data. It amounts to what might have been collected on a single piece of paper. This definition of eCRF is inherently
singular, unitary and backward-compatible with a common mental construct of a paper form.
For the FDA, an eCRF is inherently about multiple forms, collections of forms, and forward-looking. At the agency, an eCRF is now a
compilation of lots of data, possibly all of the data about one patient.
"The eCRF is a vehicle used to assemble all the data from different electronic- and paper-based systems and makes it possible to capture
and organize these diverse data in a manner that satisfies the study protocol and that enables the data to be systematically reviewed and
analyzed."
As conceived by the FDA, an eCRF is an uber-record containing both electronic and paper information. This is a legitimate perspective.
Regulators could not allow important data to escape their review simply because it was collected in one medium but not another.

team decides on whether to implement a new features, etc. )
